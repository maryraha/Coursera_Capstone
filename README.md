# Finding the Best Location to open an Ice cream Shop in Boston Area
Coursera Capstone Project to accomplish IBM professional data science certificate


This location recommendation project aims to help those who are planning to open a new business, such as an ice cream shop, find a suitable neighborhood for their business in the Boston Area. We extract and analyze the renting price, type and number of venues, and the number of competitors in each of Boston's 23 neighborhoods.  

Considering the client's budget limitations, the introduced clustering model can suggest a neighborhood with fewer competitors and walking distance to popular amenities and venues within the suggested neighborhood.
